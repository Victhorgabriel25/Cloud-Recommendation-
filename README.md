Cloud Computing Assessment

The company I chose for my assessment is called Ascobs, where I worked in 202 and 2021, it is a debt collection service provider located in Brazil, the company provides these services to local medium and large business, takes possession of their receipts of debtors, and thus contact them, making collections and negotiating agreements for the payment of these debts.

Currently, the company already uses several cloud services in its infrastructure, such as a website created by me (franquiascobs.com.br), an online digital signature system, which facilitates the collection of debtors signature, without the need for the physical presence of them in the office for this purpose, an integrated system with the main databases for credit analysis in the country, and in particular, 2 third-party softwares that enable the dynamic and integrated work of the employees:

A software called Assertiva acesses a database with personal, adress and contact information of the debtors, obtaining them by entering the person unique registration number, making it possible to simultaneously enter several records at once, generating a spreadsheet that is organized and incremented with the debt information such as amount, date and number of installments to be sent to the next software.

These worksheets, after being properly organized and added the debt information, are sent to the database of this other software called Siscobra, which makes this information available by organizing them by company, amounts, installments, due date, purchase date, type of receipt, etc. Restricting them according to the user logged into the System, his shift, which trades he charges and his level in the company.

Being responsible for the procedures listed above and for the maintence of both systems, I thought it would be very convenient to have these 2 software integrated into one, which could work as follows, just a spreadsheet or notepad with the unique registration numbers of the debtors and the debt information would be sent to this software, which would present the personal information of the debtors obtained through the database used by the first software described (Assertiva) organized in the necessary parameters, maximizing the agility in the entry of these receipts to the system, saving time and lowering the cost.

The type of deployment to be used in the reccomendation described above would be commercial, as it is a third-party software made available to the end user through the WEB by subscription.
